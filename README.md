# Neuralnetwork

It is a deep learning project.The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark in the world of machine learning. It consists of 60,000 small grayscale images of handwritten digits (ranging from 0 to 9), each sized at 28x28 pixels. The goal is to classify these digits correctly. Imagine deciphering someoneâ€™s handwriting, but with the help of a neural network.
